# Anac2021

I am honored to announce my connections that I and my teammate Ahmet Burak Yıldırım won 1st prize in 11th Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC 2020) held in conjunction with IJCAI 2020 (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence). The agent we developed “AhBuNe” did a great job in the competition.
